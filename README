Basic Remote Administration Tool (BRAT)
Copyright (C) 2018 :: Catayao56
================
This program is a basic Remote Administration Tool (RAT)
that allows you to execute commands remotely. This can be
used as a backdoor to any operating systems, as long as
the target machine has python 3 installed or the payload
is sent and executed to the target machine as a native code.
When using over WAN, both the attacker and the target machine
must have a stable internet connection. It is recommended to
compile the payload into executable binary format to hide the
code. Or else, your IP and port will be visible.
